# Vue To-Do List

A simple to-do application built with VueJS.

## Design

1. Provide an input field for new to-do items.

2. Display existing to-do items in an attractive list.

## Behavior

1. Don't require the user to click a button to add a to-do item. Add the current text automatically when they press "enter."

2. Provide a "remove" button so that to-do items can be removed when they are complete.
